## Compilation and installation
This program requires you to install [fairroot](https://fairroot.gsi.de/). Just follow the regular installation instructions.
The proper configuration for [FairSoft](https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairSoft) please enable debug without optimization and geant4.
Since FairSoft comes with it's own version of Boost, this program will set the boost root on FairSoft.
