## Introduction
```
  ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) [1] is a general purpose, heavy ion collision detector at the
CERN LHC [2]. It is designed to study the physics of strongly interacting matter, and in particular
the properties of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), using proton-proton, nucleus-nucleus and proton-nucleus
collisions at high energies. The ALICE experiment will be upgraded during the Long Shutdown 2 (LS2)
in order to exploit the full the scientific potential of the future LHC.

```
Due the impediment upgrade of the LHC, a new load balancer is required. This project has the following scope:
1. Make sure the First Level Processors (FLPs) target the same Event Processing Nodes(EPNs)
1. Make sure that FLPs skip defect/offline EPNs

## Compilation and installation
This program requires you to install [FairRoot](https://fairroot.gsi.de/). Just follow the regular installation instructions.
The proper configuration for [FairSoft](https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairSoft) is to enable debug without optimization and geant4.
Since FairSoft comes with it's own version of Boost, this program will set the boost root to use the same as FairSoft.
